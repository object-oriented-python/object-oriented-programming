A key feature of abstractions is composability: the ability to make a
complex object or operation out of several components. We can compose
objects by simply making one object a :term:`attribute` of another
object. This combines objects in a *has a* relationship. For example
the :class:`~example_code.polynomial.Polynomial` class introduced in :numref:`chapter %s
<objects>` *has a* :class:`tuple` of coefficients. Object composition of
this sort is a core part of :term:`encapsulation`.

Another way of composing abstractions is to make a new :term:`class`
by modifying another class. Typically this is employed to make a more
specialised :term:`class` from a more general one. In fact, we have
already seen this in the case of number classes. Recall that all
numbers are instances of :class:`numbers.Number`:

.. code-block:: ipython3

   In [1]: from numbers import Number

   In [2]: isinstance(1, Number)
   Out[2]: True

Hang on, though. `1` is actually an instance of :class:`int`:

.. code-block:: ipython3

   In [3]: type(1)
   Out[3]: int

   In [4]: isinstance(1, int)
   Out[4]: True

So `1`, it turns out, has :term:`type` :class:`int`, and so is an
instance of :class:`int`, but is also somehow an instance of
:class:`numbers.Number`. Mathematically, the answer is obvious:
integers form a subset of all of the numbers. Object inheritance works
in much the same way: we say that :class:`int` is a :term:`subclass`
of :class:`numbers.Number`. Just as :func:`isinstance` provides a
mechanism for determining whether an object is an :term:`instance` of
a :term:`class`, :func:`issubclass` will tell us when one
:term:`class` is a :term:`subclass` of another:

.. code-block:: ipython3

   In [5]: issubclass(int, Number)
   Out[5]: True

In fact, there is a whole hierarchy of
numeric types in :mod:`numbers`:

.. code-block:: ipython3

    In [6]: import numbers

    In [7]: issubclass(int, numbers.Integral)
    Out[7]: True

    In [8]: issubclass(numbers.Integral, numbers.Rational)
    Out[8]: True

    In [9]: issubclass(numbers.Rational, numbers.Real)
    Out[9]: True

    In [10]: issubclass(numbers.Real, numbers.Complex)
    Out[10]: True

It turns out that :func:`issubclass` is reflexive (classes are subclasses of themselves):

.. code-block:: ipython3

   In [11]: issubclass(numbers.Real, numbers.Real)
   Out[11]: True

This means that, in a manner analogous to subset inclusion, the
:term:`subclass` relationship forms a partial order on the set of all
classes. This relationship defines another core mechanism for creating a new
class from existing classes: :term:`inheritance`. If one class is a subclass of
another then we say that it inherits from that class. Where composition defines
a *has a* relationship, inheritance defines an *is a* relationship.

An example from group theory
----------------------------

In order to illustrate how composition and inheritance work, let's suppose that
we want to write a module that implements some basic groups. Recall that a group
is a collection of elements, and a group operation which obeys certain axioms.
A computer implementation of a group might therefore involve objects
representing groups, and objects representing elements. We'll lay out one
possible configuration, which helpfully involves both inheritance and
composition, as well as parametrisation of objects and delegation of methods.

Cyclic groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's start with the cyclic groups of order :math:`n`. These are isomorphic to
the integers under addition modulo :math:`n`, a property which we can use to
create our implementation. We're going to eventually want to make different
types of groups, so we're going to need to carefully consider what changes from
group to group, and what is the same. The first thing that we observe is that
different cyclic groups differ only by their order, so we could quite easily
have a single cyclic group class, and set the order when we :term:`instantiate`
it. This is pretty common: groups often come in families defined by some sort of
size parameter. A group is defined by what values its elements can take, and the
group operation. We might therefore be tempted to think that we need to define a
cyclic group element type which can take the relevant values and which
implements the group operation. This would be unfortunate for at least two
reasons:

1. Because each group needs several elements, we would need a different element *type*
   for each *instance* of a cyclic group. The number of classes needed would grow very fast!
2. Adding a new family of groups would require us to add both a group class and a
   set of element classes. On the basis of :term:`parsimony`,
   we would much prefer to only add one class in order to add a new family of
   groups.
   
Instead, we can make a single generic element type, and pass the group as an
:term:`argument` when instantiating the element. This is an example of
:term:`composition`: each element *has a* group. The group will then implement
methods which check that element values are allowed for that group, and a method
which implements the group operation. Element objects will then :term:`delegate
<delegation>` validation and the group operation back to the group object. 

Finally, we will want an :term:`infix operator` representing the group
operation. Group theorists often use a dot, but we need to choose one of the
infix operators that Python supports. We'll chose `*`, which is possibly the
closest match among Python's operators. One could easily envisage a more
complete implementation of a group, with support for group properties such as
generators and element features such as inverses. Our objective here is to
develop an understanding of class relations, rather than of algebra, so this
minimal characterisation of a group will suffice.

            return f"{type(self).__name__}({repr(self.order)})"

:numref:`cyclic_group` shows an implementation of our minimal conception of
cyclic groups. Before considering it in any detail let's try it out to observe
the concrete effects of the classes:

.. code-block:: ipython3

    In [1]: from example_code.groups_basic import CyclicGroup

    In [2]: C = CyclicGroup(5)

    In [3]: print(C(3) * C(4))
    2_C5

We observe that we are able to create the cyclic group of order 5. Due to the
definition of the :meth:`~object.__call__` :term:`special method` at line 35, we are
then able to create elements of the group by calling the group object. The group
operation then has the expected effect:

.. math::
    :label:

    3_{C_5} \cdot 4_{C_5} &\equiv (3 + 4) \operatorname{mod} 5\\
    &= 2\\ 
    &\equiv 2_{C_5}

Finally, if we attempt to make a group element with a value which is not an
integer between 0 and 5, an exception is raised.

        50 

    ValueError: Element value must be an integer in the range [0, 5)

:numref:`cyclic_group` illustrates :term:`composition`: on line 4
:class:`~example_code.groups_basic.Element`, is associated with a group object.
This is a classic *has a* relationship: an element has a group. We might have
attempted to construct this the other way around with classes having elements,
however this would have immediately hit the issue that elements have exactly one
group, while a group might have an unlimited number of elements. Object
composition is typically most successful when the relationship is uniquely
defined.

This code also demonstrates :term:`delegation`. In order to avoid having to
define different element classes for different groups, the element class does
not in substance implement either value validation, or the group operation.
Instead, at line 3, validation is delegated to the group by calling
:meth:`group._validate` and at line 10 the implementation of the group operation
is delegated to the group by calling :meth:`self.group.operation`.

General linear groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We still haven't encountered inheritance, though. Where does that come into the
story? Well first we'll need to introduce at least one more family of groups.
For no other reason than convenience, let's choose :math:`G_n`, the general
linear group of degree :math:`n`. The elements of this group can be
represented as :math:`n\times n` invertible square matrices. At least to the
extent that real numbers can be represented on a computer, we can implement this
group as follows:

.. code-block:: python3
    :caption: A basic implementation of the general linear group of a given
              degree.
    :name: general_linear_group
    :linenos:

    class GeneralLinearGroup:
        """The general linear group represented by degree x degree matrices."""

        def __init__(self, degree):
            self.degree = degree

        def _validate(self, value):
            """Ensure that value is a legitimate element value in this group."""
            if not (isinstance(value, np.ndarray),
                    value.shape == (self.degree, self.degree)):
                raise ValueError("Element value must be a "
                                f"{self.degree} x {self.degree}"
                                "square array.")

        def operation(self, a, b):
            """Perform the group operation on two values.

            The group operation is matrix multiplication.
            """
            return a @ b

        def __call__(self, value):
            """Create an element of this group."""
            return Element(self, value)

        def __str__(self):
            """Represent the group as Gd."""
            return f"G{self.degree}"

        def __repr__(self):
            """Return the canonical string representation of the group."""
            return f"{type(self).__name__}({repr(self.degree)})"

We won't illustrate the operation of this class, though the reader is welcome to
:keyword:`import` the :mod:`example_code.groups_basic` module and experiment.
Instead, we simply note that this code is very, very similar to the
implementation of :class:`~example_code.groups_basic.CyclicGroup` in
:numref:`cyclic_group`. The only functionally important differences are the
definitions of the :meth:`_validate` and :meth:`operation` methods.
`self.order` is also renamed as `self.degree`, and `C` is replaced by `G` in the
string representation. It remains the case that there is a large amount of
code repetition between classes. For the reasons we touched on in
:numref:`repetition`, this is a highly undesirable state of affairs.

Inheritance
-----------

Suppose, instead of copying much of the same code, we had a prototype
:class:`Group` class, and :class:`CyclicGroup` and :class:`GeneralLinearGroup`
simply specified the ways in which they differ from the prototype. This would
avoid the issues associated with repeating code, and would make it obvious how
the different group implementations differ. This is exactly what inheritance
does.

:numref:`groups_inheritance` shows a new implementation of
:class:`~example_code.groups.CyclicGroup` and
:class:`~example_code.groups.GeneralLinearGroup`. These are functionally
equivalent to those presented in :numref:`cyclic_group` and
:numref:`general_linear_group` but have all the repeated code removed. The code
common to both families of groups is instead placed in the
:class:`~example_code.groups.Group` class. In the following sections we will
highlight the features of this code which make this work.

Inheritance syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Look again at the definition of :class:`~example_code.groups.CyclicGroup` on
line 29:

.. code-block:: python3
    :lineno-start: 29

    class CyclicGroup(Group):    

This differs from the previous class definitions we've seen in that the
name of the class we're defining, :class:`CyclicGroup` is followed by another
class name in brackets, :class:`Group`. This :term:`syntax` is how inheritance
is defined. It means that :class:`CyclicGroup` is a :term:`child class` of
:class:`Group`. The effect of this is that any :term:`attribute` defined on the
:term:`parent class` is also defined (is *inherited*) on the child class. In
this case, :class:`CyclicGroup` does not define :meth:`__init__`,
:meth:`__call__`, :meth:`__str__`, or :meth:`__repr__`. If and when any of those
:term:`methods <method>` are called, it is the methods from the parent class,
:class:`Group` which are used. This is the mechanism that enables methods to be
shared by different classes. In this case,
:class:`~example_code.groups.CyclicGroup` and
:class:`~example_code.groups.GeneralLinearGroup` share these methods. A user
could also define another class which inherited from
:class:`~example_code.groups.Group`, for example to implement another family of
groups.

Class attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At line 32 of :numref:`groups_inheritance`, the name :attr:`symbol` is
assigned to:

.. code-block:: python3
    :lineno-start: 32

    symbol = "C"

This is also different from our previous experience: usually if we
want to set a value on an object then we do so from inside a method, and we set
a :term:`data attribute` on the current instance, `self`, using the syntax:

.. code-block:: python3

    self.symbol = "C"

This more familiar code sets an instance attribute. In other words, an attribute
specific to each object of the class. Our new version of the code instead sets a
single attribute that is common to all objects of this class. This is called a
:term:`class attribute`.

.. _runtime_attributes:

Attributes resolve at runtime
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider the :meth:`__str__` method: 

.. code-block:: python3
    :lineno-start: 16

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.symbol}{self.n}"

This code uses `self.symbol`, but this attribute isn't defined anywhere on
:class:`~example_code.groups.Group`. Why doesn't this cause an
:class:`AttributeError` to be raised? One answer is that it indeed would if we
were to instantiate :class:`Group` itself:

.. code-block:: ipython3

    In [1]: from example_code.groups import Group

    In [2]: g = Group(1)

    In [3]: print(g)
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
    <ipython-input-3-e1cdc681402c> in <module>
    ----> 1 print(g)

    ~/docs/principles_of_programming/object-oriented-programming/example_code/groups.py in __str__(self)
        61     def __str__(self):
        62         """Return a string in the form symbol then group parameter."""
    ---> 63         return f"{self.symbol}{self.n}"
        64 
        65     def __repr__(self):

In fact, :class:`Group` is never supposed to be instantiated, it plays the role
of an :term:`abstract base class`. In other words, it's role is to provide
functionality to classes that inherit from it, rather than to be the type of
objects itself. We will return to this in more detail in
:numref:`abstract_base_classes`.

However, if we instead instantiate :class:`~example_code.groups.CyclicGroup`
then everything works:

.. code-block:: ipython3

    In [1]: from example_code.groups import CyclicGroup

    In [2]: g = CyclicGroup(1)

    In [3]: print(g)
    C1

The reason is that the code in methods is only executed when that method is
called, and the object `self` is the actual concrete class instance, with all of
the attributes that are defined for it. In this case, even though
:meth:`__str__` is defined on :class:`Group`, `self` has type
:class:`CyclicGroup`, and therefore `self.symbol` is well-defined and has the
value `"C"`.

Parametrising over class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When we create a class, there is always the possibility that someone will come
along later and create a subclass of it. It is therefore an important design
principle to avoid doing anything which might cause a problem in a subclass.
One important example of this is anywhere where it is assumed that the class of
:data:`self` is in fact the current class and not some subclass of it. For this
reason, it is almost always a bad idea to explicitly use the name of the
current class inside its definition. Instead, we should use the fact that
`type(self)` returns the type (i.e. class) of the current object. It is for
this reason that we typically use the formula `type(self).__name__` in the
:meth:`~object.__repr__` method of an object. A similar procedure applies if we
need to create another object of the same class as the current object. For
example, one might create the next larger :class:`~example_code.groups.Group`
than the current one with:

.. code-block:: python3

    type(self)(self.n+1)

Observe that since `type(self)` is a :term:`class`, we can :term:`instantiate`
it by calling it.

Calling parent class methods
----------------------------

.. code-block:: python3
    :caption: The elementary rectangle class from :mod:`example_code.shapes`.
    :linenos:

    class Rectangle:

        def area(self):
            return self.length * self.width

        def __repr__(self):
            return f"{type(self).__name__}{self.length, self.width!r}"

:numref:`rectangle_class` shows a basic implementation of a class describing a
rectangle. We might also want a class defining a square. Rather than redefining
everything from scratch, we might choose to :term:`inherit <inheritance>` from
:class:`~example_code.shapes.Rectangle` by defining a square as a rectangle
whose length and width are equal. The :term:`constructor` for our new class
will, naturally, just take a single `length` parameter. However the
:meth:`~example_code.shapes.Rectangle.area` method that we will inherit expects
both `self.length` and `self.width` to be defined. We could simply define both
length and width in :meth:`Square.__init__`, but this is exactly the sort of
copy and paste code that inheritance is supposed to avoid. If the parameters to
:meth:`Rectangle.__init__` were to be changed at some future point, then having
`self.length` and `self.width` defined in two separate places is likely to lead
to very confusing bugs. 

Instead, we would like to have :meth:`Square.__init__` call
:meth:`Rectangle.__init__` and pass the same value for both length and width. It
is perfectly possible to directly call :meth:`Rectangle.__init__`, but this
breaks the style rule that we should not repeat ourselves: if :class:`Square`
already inherits from :class:`~example_code.shapes.Rectangle` then it should not
be necessary to restate that inheritance by explicitly naming the :term:`parent
class`. Fortunately, python provides the functionality we need in the form of
the :func:`super` function. :numref:`square_class` demonstrates its application.

.. _square_class:

.. code-block:: python3
    :caption: :class:`example_code.shapes.Square` inherits from
        :class:`~example_code.shapes.Rectangle` and calls the latter's
        :term:`constructor` using :func:`super`.
    :linenos:

    class Square(Rectangle):

        def __init__(self, length):
            super().__init__(length, length)

        def __repr__(self):
            return f"{type(self).__name__}({self.length!r})"

The :func:`super` function returns a version of the current object in which none
of the :term:`methods <method>` have been overridden by the current
:term:`class`. This has the effect that the :term:`superclasses <superclass>` of
the current class are searched in increasing inheritance order until a matching
method name is found, and this method is then called. This provides a safe
mechanism for calling parent class methods in a way that responds appropriately
if someone later comes back and rewrites the inheritance relationships of the
classes involved.

Creating new exception classes
------------------------------

Python provides a wide range of :term:`exceptions <exception>`, and usually the
right thing to do when writing code that might need to raise an exception is to
peruse the :doc:`list of built-in exceptions <library/exceptions>` and choose
the one which best matches the circumstances. However, sometimes there is no
good match, or it might be that the programmer wants user code to be able to
catch exactly this exception without the risk that some other operation will
raise the same exception and be caught by mistake. In this case, it is necessary
to create a new type of exception. 

A new exception will be a new :term:`class` which inherits from another
exception class. In most cases, the only argument that the exception
:term:`constructor` takes is an error message, and the base :class:`Exception`
class already takes this. This means that the subclass definition may only need
to define the new class. Now, a class definition is a Python block and, as a
matter of :term:`syntax`, a block cannot be empty. Fortunately, the Python
language caters for this situation with the :keyword:`pass` statement, which
simply does nothing. For example, suppose we need to be able to distinguish the
:class:`ValueError` which occurs in entity validation from other occurrences of
:class:`ValueError`. For example it might be advantageous to enable a user to
catch exactly these errors. In this case, we're still talking about some form
of value error, so we'll want our new error class to inherit from
:class:`ValueError`. We could achieve this as follows:

.. code-block:: python3

    class GroupValidationError(ValueError):
        pass

.. 
    .. _abstract_base_classes:

    Abstract base classes
    ---------------------

    We observed in :numref:`runtime_attributes` that the
    :class:`~example_code.groups.Group` class isn't itself a complete implementation
    of a mathematical group. Instead it is only intended to be used as a
    :term:`parent class` for classes implementing actual groups. Those child classes
    are responsible for filling out the additional details required to make a
    working implementation. In the case of `Group`, the child classes have to
    implement :attr:`symbol`, :meth:`_validation`, and :meth:`operation`, with the
    right interfaces. 

    How would a programmer who wants to implement a new family of groups know to
    implement this one attribute and two methods, with these particular interfaces?
    In a simple case like this, they could probably infer what was needed by
    studying the source code of :class:`Group` and its two subclasses. However "just
    work it out from context" is not a particularly robust mechanism and will
    quickly become infeasible for larger, more complex classes. 

    Instead of leaving it to the programmer to figure out, it would be preferable if
    :class:`Group` specified the missing parts to be filled out, including the
    required interfaces. We call such
    classes :term:`abstract base classes <abstract base class>`. They are abstract
    in the sense that the interface is specified but the implementation omitted. 


Glossary
--------

.. glossary::
    :sorted:

    child class
        A class which :term:`inherits <inheritance>` directly from one or more
        :term:`parent classes <parent class>`. The child class automatically has
        all of the :term:`methods <method>` of the parent classes, unless it
        declares its own methods with the same names.

    class attribute
        An :term:`attribute` which is declared directly on a :term:`class`.
        All instances of a class see the same value of a class attribute.

    composition
        The process of making a more complex object from other objects by
        including the constituent objects as attributes of the more composite
        object. Composition can be characterised as a *has a* relationship, in
        contrast to :term:`inheritance`, which embodies an *is a* relationship.

    delegation
        A design pattern in which an object avoids implementing a
        :term:`method` by instead calling a method on another object. 

    inheritance
        The process of making a new class by extending or modifying one or more existing
        classes. 

    parent class
        A class from which another class, referred to as a :term:`child class`,
        inherits. Inheritance can be characterised as an *is a* relationship, in
        contrast to :term:`composition`, which embodies an *has a* relationship.

    subclass
        A class `A` is a subclass of the class `B` if `A` inherits from `B` either
        directly or indirectly. That is, if `B` is a :term:`parent <parent class>`, 
        grandparent, great grandparent or further ancestor of `A`. Contrast
        :term:`superclass`.

    superclass
        A class `A` is a superclass of the class `B` if `B` inherits from `A` either
        directly or indirectly. That is, if `B` is a :term:`subclass` of `A`.

.. proof:exercise::

    The symmetric group over `n` symbols is the group whose members are all the
    permutations of `n` symbols and whose group operation is the composition of
    those permutations: :math:`a \cdot b = a(b)`.

    In this week's skeleton code repository, create package called
    :mod:`groups` containing a module called :mod:`symmetric_groups`. Define a
    new class :class:`SymmetricGroup` which inherits from
    :class:`example_code.groups.Group` and implements the symmetric group of
    order `n`. You will need to implement the group operation and the
    validation of group element values. Group elements can be represented by
    sequences containing permutations of the integers from 0 to `n-1`. You will
    find it advantageous to represent these permutations as
    :class:`numpy.ndarray` because the indexing rules for that type mean that
    the group operation can simply be implemented by indexing the first
    permutation with the second: `a[b]`.

    You will also need to set the :term:`class attribute` :attr:`symbol`. For this
    group, this should take the value `S`.
    
    .. hint::

        You will need to :keyword:`import` :class:`example_code.groups.Group`
        from the `object_oriented_programming` repository that you installed
        :ref:`in week 2 <course_repo>`. You should also `git pull` in that
        repository in order to get any changes that have happened in the
        intervening period.

    .. hint::

        In implementing element validation, the builtin function :func:`sorted`
        is likely to be useful.


.. proof:exercise::

    The objective of this exercise is to create subclasses of the built-in
    :class:`set` class which are only valid for values which pass a certain
    test. For example, one might have a set which can only contain integers.

    1. In this week's repository, create a package called :mod:`sets` containing a
       module `verified_sets`. Create a subclass of the inbuilt :class:`set`,
       :class:`sets.verified_sets.VerifiedSet`. :class:`VerifiedSet` will itself 
       be the parent of other classes which have particular verification rules.

    2. Give :class:`VerifiedSet` a method :meth:`_verify` which takes a single
       value. In the case of :class:`VerifiedSet`, :meth:`_verify` should
       unconditionally raise :class:`NotImplementedError`. Subclasses of
       :class:`VerifiedSet` will override this method to do something more useful.

    3. For each :class:`set` method which adds items to the set,
       :class:`VerifiedSet` will need to have its own version which calls
       :meth:`_verify` on each item, before calling the appropriate superclass
       method in order to actually insert the value(s). The methods which add
       items to a set are :meth:`~frozenset.add`, :meth:`~frozenset.update`, and
       :meth:`~frozenset.symmetric_difference_update`. 

    4. For those methods which create a new set, :class:`VerifiedSet` will also
       need to :term:`instantiate` a new object, so that the method returns a subclass of
       :class:`VerifiedSet` instead of a plain :class:`set`.  The methods to which
       this applies are :meth:`~frozenset.union`, :meth:`~frozenset.intersection`,
       :meth:`~frozenset.difference`, :meth:`~frozenset.symmetric_difference`, and
       :meth:`~frozenset.copy`.

    5. Create a subclass of :class:`VerifiedSet` called :class:`IntSet` in which
       only integers (i.e. instances of :class:`numbers.Integral`) are allowed.
       On encountering a non-integer :meth:`IntSet._verify` should raise
       :class:`TypeError` with an error message of the following form. For example
       if an attempt were made to add a string to the set, the message would be
       "IntSet expected an integer, got a str.".

    6. Create a subclass of :class:`VerifiedSet` called :class:`UniqueSet` into
       which values can only be added if they are not already in the set. You
       should create a new exception :class:`UniquenessError`, a subclass of
       :class:`KeyError`. :class:`UniqueSet._verify` should raise this if an
       operation would add a duplicate value to the :class:`UniqueSet`.
