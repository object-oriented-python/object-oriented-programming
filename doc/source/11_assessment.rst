Assessment
==========

For those taking this course for credit, an assessment is required.
This will take the form of a report, since that is how MMSC special
topics are assessed.


.. proof:exercise::

    Implement a Python package that solves a class of PDE problems.
    The class of problems to be solved and the discretisations employed
    are up to you. A simple example might be to solve the heat equation
    in a box with a given initial condition, using finite differences
    in space and Crank-Nicolson in time.

    The code may use any available Python packages such as numpy and
    scipy; do not reinvent the wheel. However, your code should contain
    an original contribution; do not just copy someone else's code. In
    particular your code must be sufficiently different from any available
    code samples for such problems to be found on the internet.

    Write a 10--20 page report describing the class of PDEs to be solved, the
    discretisations employed, and the Python code written. Special
    attention should be paid to how the code is organised, and how
    the code is tested.

    The report will be assessed primarily on the beauty, elegance,
    and correctness of the code. Other factors under consideration will
    include the mathematical interest of the class of PDEs solved
    and discretisations employed, and the application of the PDE solver
    to interesting problems.

    Of course, it may be of interest to you to consider other kinds of
    problems (previous submissions implemented various graph algorithms,
    for example). If you'd like to do something different to that described
    above, please contact the course lecturer to discuss your proposal.
