   This is the online textbook for MATH50009 Principles of Programming, a
   second year object oriented programming module offered to mathematics
   undergraduates at Imperial College London. Read the introductory chapter for
   information on how to go about doing the module week by week.

   If you're not taking the module at Imperial, you should nonetheless feel
   free to use this material to learn object-oriented programming in Python. I
   would be very interested to hear from anyone interested in using it to
   teach.
