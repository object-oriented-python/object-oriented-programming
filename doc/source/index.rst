This is the online textbook for the Oxford course on Python in Scientific
Computing, offered to MSc students on the MSc in Mathematical Modelling and
Scientific Computing, and to DPhil students. The lecturer for this course
is `Patrick E. Farrell <https://pefarrell.org>`_. Please address all
questions about the course to Dr Farrell.

This course is a fork of the MATH50009 Principles of Programming course
prepared by `David A. Ham <https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/david.ham>`_,
offered to mathematics undergraduates at
Imperial College London. Dr Farrell is very grateful to Dr Ham for his kind and
generous assistance in this matter.

Please read the introductory chapter for information on how to
go about doing the module week by week.
